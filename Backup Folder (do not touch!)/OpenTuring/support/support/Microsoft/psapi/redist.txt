====================
PSAPI for Windows NT
====================

To install the PSAPI helper DLL on Windows NT copy PSAPI.DLL into
the %windir%\System directory.  The PSAPI.DLL should never be installed over
an existing copy of the same DLL that has a later version resource.  The
PSAPI.DLL should never be installed on a Windows 95 system (it will not work).

For Windows 2000, use the system-supplied psapi.dll; do not install a new 
psapi.dll (it will fail due to Windows File Protection). 

The version of PSAPI.DLL that can be redistributed is located in 
the \Redist\PSApi\x86 directory in the Platform SDK.

In addition to the rights granted in Section 1 of the Agreement ("Agreement"), 
with respect to the PSAPI DLL for Windows NT Redistributable Code, you have 
the following non-exclusive, royalty free rights subject to the Distribution 
Requirements detailed in Section 1 of the Agreement:

(1)  You may distribute PSAPI.DLL.
